18+ Age Gateway helps your website comply with the UK Digital Economy Act, 2017, by requiring visitors from the UK to verify their age.
== Description ==
The UK's Digital Economy Act, 2017, scheduled to come into effect on 15 July 2019, will require UK based residents to verify their age as 18+ prior to accessing adult content on the Internet. This plugin enables your website to comply with the law. Simply activate the plugin and visitors from UK IP addresses automatically will be shown a UK compliant age verification overlay. To pass this age gateway, the UK visitor will need to use the FREE 18+ app to verify his age.

Visitors verify their age 18+ status anonymously.  Neither you nor 18+ will learn the identity of the visitor. 

You can customise the look and feel of the age gateway by adjusting the plugin settings.
== Installation ==
To install:
1. Upload the plugin files to the /wp-content/plugins/plugin-name directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Use the Settings->Plugin Name screen to configure the plugin. Make sure the Age Gateway is turned on.

The plugin will only display an age gateway to UK IP addresses after 15 July 2019. To test the plugin from other IP addresses or before the law is effective, use the tools on the settings page.
